# Installation guide for Users

1. Add Redminportal to composer.json of a new Laravel application, under "require". Like this:

        "require": {
            "laravel/framework": "4.2.*",
            "redooor/redminportal": "0.1.*"
        },

Due to the use of getID3 package, we need to set the minimum-stability to "dev" but prefer-stable to "true". Like this:

        "minimum-stability": "dev",
        "prefer-stable": true

2. Then run `php composer install` in a terminal.
3. Then add Redooor\Redminportal to your app\config\app.php providers array like this:

        'providers' => array(
            'Illuminate\Foundation\Providers\ArtisanServiceProvider',
            ... omitted ...
            'Illuminate\Workbench\WorkbenchServiceProvider',
            'Cartalyst\Sentry\SentryServiceProvider',
            'Redooor\Redminportal\RedminportalServiceProvider',
        ),

4. Then run `php artisan dump-autoload` in a terminal.
5. Run the following commands in a terminal to perform database migration for both Redminportal and Sentry:

        ?> php artisan migrate --package=cartalyst/sentry
        ?> php artisan migrate --package=redooor/redminportal

6. Run the following in a terminal to seed the database with initial admin username and password:

        ?> php artisan db:seed --class="RedminSeeder"
        Username/password: admin@admin.com/admin

7. Publish package assets by running this in a terminal:

        php artisan asset:publish redooor/redminportal

8. Publish package config by running this in a terminal:

        php artisan config:publish redooor/redminportal

# Installation guide for Contributors

1. Clone the Redooor\Redminportal repository into workbench\redooor\redminportal folder.
2. Then add Redooor\Redminportal to your app\config\app.php providers array like this:

        'providers' => array(
            'Illuminate\Foundation\Providers\ArtisanServiceProvider',
            ... omitted ...
            'Illuminate\Workbench\WorkbenchServiceProvider',
            'Cartalyst\Sentry\SentryServiceProvider',
            'Redooor\Redminportal\RedminportalServiceProvider',
        ),

3. Then run `php composer update` in workspace\redoooor\redminportal folder.
4. Then run `php artisan dump-autoload` in a terminal.
5. This Package is dependant on Cartalyst Sentry. In order to do the database migration and seeding, we'll need to add it to the main application's composer.json file, under "require":

        "require": {
            "laravel/framework": "4.2.*",
            "cartalyst/sentry": "2.1.*"
        },

Due to the use of getID3 package, we need to set the minimum-stability to "dev" but prefer-stable to "true". Like this:

        "minimum-stability": "dev",
        "prefer-stable": true
        
6. Then run `php composer update` in the main app folder.
7. Run the following commands in a terminal to perform database migration for both Redminportal and Sentry:

        ?> php artisan migrate --package=cartalyst/sentry
        ?> php artisan migrate --bench=redooor/redminportal

8. Run the following in a terminal to seed the database with initial admin username and password:

        ?> php artisan db:seed --class="RedminSeeder"
        Username/password: admin@admin.com/admin

9. Publish package assets by running this in a terminal:

        php artisan asset:publish --bench=redooor/redminportal

10. Publish package config by running this in a terminal:

        php artisan config:publish --path="workbench/redooor/redminportal/src/config" redooor/redminportal
